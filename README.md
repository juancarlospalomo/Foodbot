# Foodbot
This is a chatbot built using the Bot Framework SDK that allows you to query the [food2fork api](http://food2fork.com/) for recipes by asking for certain types of food, ingredients, or specific dishes. It utilizes Microsoft Language Understanding Intelligent Service [(LUIS)](https://www.luis.ai) to allows more natural language for commands. Such as instead of saying "pizza", you can say "Pizza sounds really good right now".
